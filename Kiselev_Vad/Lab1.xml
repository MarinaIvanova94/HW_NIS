      At number four it's the Ferrari 458 Italia of 2008 - amazing looks, screaming V8 and Italian pedigree all wrapped up in an intoxicating package. Hard to believe it's almost four years old already. The maximum speed is 320.

     <car name="Bugatti Veyron" Year_of_production="2006">

         Top 10 Cars For Past 20 Years

      <speed max_speed = "407">
      </speed>


      <description>
'Following heated discussion and a staggering response online, the Bugatti Veyron(released 2006) emerged as a worthy winner,' said Charlie Turner, editor of BBC Top Gear magazine. 'In its latest iteration, the world's fastest car costs two million euros, makes 1,187bhp and 1,107lb ft from its 8.0-litre engine, will hit 407 and burn eight litres of fuel every minute while doing so. But it is more than just a sledgehammer of physics. The Veyron is the distilled essence of the Volkswagen empire: as luxurious as a Bentley, with the build quality to put an Audi A8 to shame. Whether we will see its like again is open to question. However we do know the car industryâ€™s desire to improve itself, its technology and its products continues to gain momentum, and the gathering pace of change is set to make the next two decades an even greater adventure'. The maximum speed is 407.
